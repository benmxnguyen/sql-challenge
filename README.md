This assignment allowed me to practice and demonstrate my skills with PostGresSQL.

About the dataset:
The dataset contained information regarding a company, its employees, managers, departments, job titles, and salaries.

Given a number of datasets, I had to study their structure and write a query that would then create an appropriate table for each set. Next, I populated the tables by importing the data from a csv file. 

There were a set of queries I had to write in order to view the columns of interest. This required the use of joining tables and filtering out the data.
